TODO:
Fix the readme.md
Make an agile team
Felix and Fred: Work with player movement
Kaja and Benjamin: Work with the battle screen.
Tobias and Maja: Make the load game button work as intended. 

Already done:
Team 1:
Made a main-menu screen that starts a new game. Have not been able to create the load game feature yet.

Team 2:
Made the player and its movement. 

Summary:
We must include everyone in the group to contribute to the project. Try to do independant work instead of always 
pair-programming. Ask for help if that's needed. Need to make descriptive commit-messages when you commit 
something to git.
Remember to push if you have written a bit of code even though you may not be completely done.
