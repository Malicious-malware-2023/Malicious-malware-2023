## Project report

### Team roles

All team members currently are developers, with Benjamin God√∏ Mulelid as team lead, and Fredrik Limi Ballestad as secretary.
We think that adding more roles at this point adds needless complexity to the project,
and we do not have enough capacity to simulate having different "departments".

We thought about having separate QA people, but this is difficult as the course requires all team members to write code.
Instead, every developer is responsible for testing their own code, and the code is also reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

Our current roles are the absolute minimum required to make the team work.
The team lead is responsible for setting up meetings, and the secretary records important information from them.
Other than that, all members are developers, meaning that every team member writes, tests, and commits code.

We will not switch team lead or secretary yet, but we may switch at a later stage if the roles are not properly fulfilled,
or if we want to switch things up out of curiosity.

In summary, we like being flexible rather than having fixed roles for everyone. For the moment, we do not intend to change anything about this.

### Team dynamics and communication

We have had good experiences with creating groups of two people that work together on solving a task.
Some groups have gotten tasks that were noticeably larger than those of other groups,
and we will try to break those larger tasks down going forward.
There are no disagreements in the team yet. Discussions regarding both team coordination and development have been friendly and productive.

Communication via Discord works well. We have sometimes forgotten to update the "Issues" board in GitLab,
which has left some confusion regarding who solved which task.
User stories have not been sufficiently descriptive, which makes requested features ambiguous and hard to implement.

### Retrospective

The team has implemented new features consistently, and everyone has had something to work on at all times.
We want to shorten our sprints to one week rather than the two weeks we have been used to.
This is because the release candidate will have to be ready in about a month.

Some features were harder to implement, which is why some features (like saving and drawing the UI) have fewer commits in a longer timespan.
This explains some of the unevenness of commits. Team members also have different approaches to committing,
as some only commits after finishing a feature while others commit more frequently during development.

Areas that we will try to improve are:
- Making more and smaller issues on the "Issues" board. 
- Keep the "Issues" board updated and create more descriptive user stories.
- Announce clearly who is working on what for every sprint.

## Requirements and specification

We have prioritized the core game mechanics and visuals:
- Rendering a tile map and a player.
- Player movement and interaction with the world.
- Battle system.
- Mechanics for switching between world view and battle view.
- Start and pause menu.

Our MVP is still ahead of us, and we think that we will scrap all online functionality for now.
The priority is creating every core part of the game, and then connecting them together.

After creating the battle system and polishing the world view, we will focus on polishing the game that we have created.
The next sprint will be dedicated to polishing, and then we will implement the remaining features from the MVP in the last sprints.
