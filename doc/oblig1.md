## Game concept

### General gameplay

The game is based on the Pok√©mon games.
The player goes around meeting monsters called Kaijumon.
Upon meeting a Kaijumon, the player may either defeat it using their own Kaijumon,
or they may become friends with it.
After befriending the player, the Kaijumon will follow them and aid them in battle.

Wild Kaijumon are encountered in the wilderness.
The player may also battle other human characters who have Kaijumon of their own.

### Progression
Multiple human characters with unusually strong Kaijumon are spread across the map.
Defeat them all to become the best trainer.

Kaijumon may level up upon defeating many enemies. This increases stats such as strength, defence, etc.
Most Kaijumon evolve at certain levels, meaning that their appearance changes.

### Online
A player may connect to another player and fight them.
Multiple players can play together on the same map,
either aiding or battling each other.



## Development methodology

### Continuous deployment

The team will use agile methodologies as described in the course literature,
focusing on releasing small features as they are implemented.

The team will use GitLab Issues as a Kanban board, where board items are connected
to GitLab Milestones with more detailed user stories.

A sprint is usually 1-2 weeks, depending on the complexity of the tasks.

### Pair programming

The team will usually assign tasks to groups of 2-3 people, such that no developer is left alone to solve a task.
These groups will regularly practice pair programming.

Tasks and groups are assigned at the start of every sprint.

### Communication

The team communicates via a Discord server. All merge requests are posted there.

### Git workflow

A git branch is created for every task. A merge request is created upon completion.
It is recommended to merge the main branch into your branch before submitting a merge request,
as it is easier to deal with merge conflicts in your IDE.

### Meetings

A meeting is held at the start of every sprint. New features are presented by their creators,
and new tasks are assigned to new groups.



## Minimum viable product

A minimum viable product consists of:
* An area where the player can battle and befriend Kaijumons.
* NPCs that the player can battle.
* One more challenging NPC that functions like a boss battle.



## Summary

Teams of 3 people sometimes led to the third person being passive,
as it was hard to find a time when all team members were available for pair programming.

We will experiment with doing more independent work instead of always pair-programming.
Always ask for help if that's needed.
We need to make more descriptive commit-messages when you commit something to git.

We need to avoid having code that is stuck locally. Remember to commit and push often.
It is OK to have commits where a feature is not fully implemented.
